Go Kibitz
=========

Go Kibitz ~~is~~ will be a next-generation `sgf` editor and viewer.

It will be implemented in html/js/css, ala the oustanding [Eidogo](http://eidogo.com/). The goal is to expand a couple areas where Eidogo lacks features, such as allowing per-move commenting for embedded games, offering a better interface for go problems, and providing an embeddable viewer that is responsive-ready.

This is something I'm working on for fun, and may never be completed.
