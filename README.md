Go Kibitz
=========

Go Kibitz ~~is~~ will be a next-generation sgf editor and viewer.

It will be implemented in html/js/css, following in the tradition of the oustanding [Eidogo](http://eidogo.com/). The goal is to create an embeddable sgf viewer that expands a couple areas where Eidogo lacks features, such as allowing per-move commenting, offering a better interface for go problems, and improving the interface for mobile devices. I have no ambition to even attempt to rival many of Eidogo's more advanced features such as its pattern search, pro game database, or joseki tutor.

This is something I'm working on for fun, and may never be completed.
